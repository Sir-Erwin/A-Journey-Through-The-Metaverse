# A Journey Through The Metaverse

Please read the following before continuing...

        Disclaimer: The following, though may be reminiscent of real life people or things are not. This is purely a work of fiction.

        The Metaverse is a dangerous place. Filled with deadly distractions and hidden glitches. Invisible to the naked Oculus, these threats could crash your session, or worse destroy your whole profile. Can you traverse the dangerous trails of the Metaverse to order Panda Express in time to feed your metamate.

        Your round indicates how close you are to Panda Express. You win when you reach round 12.

        Your battery round, is analogous to your life. It starts at 30 decreases every round and if defeated by a threat. You can recharge your device but your metamate will still grow hungry. Note that running out of battery will delete all your unsaved data.

        Your metamate's hunger starts at 0 and goes till 10.

        If you don't reach round 12 before your metamate's hunger reaches 10, you loose.

        You may choose to save your progress before the battery runs out, but that costs battery too.

        You will have to interact with various phenomenon in the metaverse, some will help you reach your destination more quickly, but some will delay you and will cause you to loose battery.

        May the odds be ever in your favor.
